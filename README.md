# TEXT STYLING PRACTICE
A small python project to help me learn and pracice string styling/formatting.

## Features
- Menu system
- Summary Menu
- Uppercase version
- Lowercase version
- Reversed text
- Vowel count
- Consonant count
- Number of words
- Remove all spaces
- Check if it is a palindrome (same forwards & backwards)

## Why I made this
I'm learning Python and string handling is one of my worse topics, this should help me build more confidence.
This is a ChatGPT generated project.

## How is AI being used in this project?
I am only using AI to ask how for help, not to do it for me. Questions such as "Teach me how to use a try except block correctly".
